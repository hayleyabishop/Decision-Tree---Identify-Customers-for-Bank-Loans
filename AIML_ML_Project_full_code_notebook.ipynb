The majority of these customers are liability customers (depositors) with varying sizes of deposits. The number of customers who are also borrowers (asset customers) is quite small, and the bank is interested in expanding this base rapidly to bring in more loan business and in the process, earn more through the interest on loans. In particular, the management wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors).\n","\n","A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. This has encouraged the retail marketing department to devise campaigns with better target marketing to increase the success ratio.\n","\n","You as a Data scientist at AllLife bank have to build a model that will help the marketing department to identify the potential customers who have a higher probability of purchasing the loan."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"s4T59mPjxMmc"},"source":["### Objective\n","\n","To predict whether a liability customer will buy personal loans, to understand which customer attributes are most significant in driving purchases, and identify which segment of customers to target more."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"FN8fKs4_xPLS"},"source":["### Data Dictionary\n","* `ID`: Customer ID\n","* `Age`: Customerâ€™s age in completed years\n","* `Experience`: #years of professional experience\n","* `Income`: Annual income of the customer (in thousand dollars)\n","* `ZIP Code`: Home Address ZIP code.\n","* `Family`: the Family size of the customer\n","* `CCAvg`: Average spending on credit cards per month (in thousand dollars)\n","* `Education`: Education Level. 1: Undergrad; 2: Graduate;3: Advanced/Professional\n","* `Mortgage`: Value of house mortgage if any.

However, I know that many must in reality be categorical variables. From the variable description, I suggest the following changes:\n","\n","0. Customer `ID` is an integer, and the integer number indicates the ID, NOT a quantitative metric about the customer. Therefore, Customer ID should be treated like alphabetical strings, `obj64`.\n","1. `Age` (years) stays `int64`, but could be downcast to `int8` (-128:127) to save RAM. Age cannot be negative.\n","2. Years professional `Experience` stays `int64`, but could be downcast to `int8` (-128:127). Experience cannot be negative.\n","3. `Income` in thousands should become `float` point, since it could be divided down to the fraction of a dollar, and there is no memory-saving using `int64` vs `float64`. \n","4. `ZIP Code` needs to be changed to a string variable. When using Zip Codes numerically, we should use a geographic representation of the Zip Codes (ex. lat/long of the center of the zip code area). \n","5. `Family` (in # of people) stays an `integer`.\n","6. `CCavg` is 1000's of dollars spent per month on credit cards, and should stay a `float` point. Family cannot be negative.\n","7. `Education` actually needs to be converted to a `categorical` variable with mapping of \"`1: Undergrad; 2: Graduate; 3: Advanced/Professional`\". We should keep the `order` of the categories, since we may want to see a comparison in order of ranking. \n","8. `Mortgage` should also change to a `float64`, since it is a dollar amount (1000s). Mortgage can be zero, but cannot be negative. NaN values could be zero, and vice-versa.\n","9. `Personal_Loan` is a binary number indicating 1 for Yes and 0 for No. I will leave it as an `int64`, since that is standard practice for one-hot encoded variables with machine learning algorithms. \n","10. `Securities_Account` is a binary number indicating 1 for Yes and 0 for No. I will leave it as an `int64`, since that is standard practice for one-hot encoded variables with machine learning algorithms. \n","11. `CD_Account` is a binary number indicating 1 for Yes and 0 for No. I will leave it as an `int64`, since that is standard practice for one-hot encoded variables with machine learning algorithms. \n","12. `Online` is a binary number indicating 1 for Yes and 0 for No. I will leave it as an `int64`, since that is standard practice for one-hot encoded variables with machine learning algorithms.\n","13. `CreditCard` is a binary number indicating 1 for Yes and 0 for No. I will leave it as an `int64`, since that is standard practice for one-hot encoded variables with machine learning algorithms."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":40,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\n","RangeIndex: 5000 entries, 0 to 4999\n","Data columns (total 14 columns):\n"," #   Column              Non-Null Count  Dtype  \n","---  ------              --------------  -----  \n"," 0   ID                  5000 non-null   string \n"," 1   Age                 5000 non-null   int64  \n"," 2   Experience          5000 non-null   int64  \n"," 3   Income              5000 non-null   float64\n"," 4   ZIPCode             5000 non-null   string \n"," 5   Family              5000 non-null   int64  \n"," 6   CCAvg               5000 non-null   float64\n"," 7   Education           5000 non-null   int64  \n"," 8   Mortgage            5000 non-null   float64\n"," 9   Personal_Loan       5000 non-null   int64  \n"," 10  Securities_Account  5000 non-null   int64  \n"," 11  CD_Account          5000 non-null   int64  \n"," 12  Online              5000 non-null   int64  \n"," 13  CreditCard          5000 non-null   int64  \n","dtypes: float64(3), int64(9), string(2)\n","memory usage: 547.0 KB\n"]}],"source":["df.describe()\n","df.ID = df[\"ID\"].astype(\"string\")\n","df.Income = df.Income.astype(\"float\")\n","df.ZIPCode = df.ZIPCode.astype(\"string\")\n","df.Mortgage = df.Mortgage.astype(\"float\")\n","df.info()\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Exploratory Data Analysis."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["- EDA is an important part of any project involving data.\n","- It is important to investigate and understand the data better before building a model with it.\n","- A few questions have been mentioned below which will help you approach the analysis in the right manner and generate insights from the data.\n","- A thorough analysis of the data, in addition to the questions mentioned below, should be done."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["**Questions**:\n","\n","1.

made it easy to accidentally put in a negative number. Perhaps some users entered this number intentionally, and it means something to them. Perhaps the data was corrupted. Perhaps the 'experience' number was too high for the form, ex. 50 years, and the item wrapped around again (unlikely since the Ages are all between 23 and 29).
